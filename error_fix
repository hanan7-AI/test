The error message indicates that you are trying to build the llvmlite package, but it is failing because it requires LLVM version 14, while your system has LLVM version 11.0.1. This incompatibility is causing the build process to fail on your Raspberry Pi 3 with Python 3.9.

Here's how you can address the issue:

Upgrade LLVM:
You need to install LLVM version 14 or higher. Here’s how you can do it:

First, uninstall the current LLVM version:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get remove llvm
Then, add the appropriate LLVM repository and install version 14:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install llvm-14 llvm-14-dev llvm-14-tools clang-14
Set the Correct LLVM_CONFIG Path:
After installing LLVM 14, you need to make sure llvmlite uses the correct llvm-config executable. You can set it as follows:

Find the path of llvm-config-14:

bash
Copy code
which llvm-config-14
Set the LLVM_CONFIG environment variable to this path:

bash
Copy code
export LLVM_CONFIG=/path/to/llvm-config-14
Make sure to replace /path/to/llvm-config-14 with the actual path found in the previous step.

Reinstall llvmlite:
After configuring LLVM, you can try installing llvmlite again:

bash
Copy code
pip install llvmlite
These steps should resolve the issue and allow you to successfully build and install llvmlite. Let me know if you need further assistance!

It seems you are sharing a snippet of code that imports various libraries such as argparse, numpy, matplotlib, librosa, etc., and sets up logging and common modules like com and keras_model. Could you clarify your intent or let me know how I can assist you further with this? For example, are you facing an issue with this code, or would you like help modifying it in some way?

If you're encountering an error when trying to install librosa on your Raspberry Pi 3, it could be due to a number of reasons, such as missing dependencies or version compatibility issues. Here’s how you can troubleshoot and fix the problem.

1. Check for Required Dependencies
librosa requires several dependencies to work correctly, including numpy, scipy, and soundfile. First, make sure they are installed:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-dev libsndfile1
2. Install librosa Dependencies Using pip
You can also use pip to ensure the required Python dependencies are installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy scipy audioread soundfile
3. Install librosa
After installing the dependencies, try installing librosa again:

bash
Copy code
pip install librosa
4. Ensure Compatibility
If you're using Python 3.9 on your Raspberry Pi, some libraries may not be fully compatible or might require specific versions. You can try installing a specific version of librosa that works with your setup, such as:

bash
Copy code
pip install librosa==0.8.0
5. Consider Using a Virtual Environment
If the system Python environment is causing conflicts, you can set up a virtual environment to isolate your packages:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv librosa_env
source librosa_env/bin/activate
pip install librosa
This will create a clean environment for librosa and its dependencies.

6. Check Error Logs
If the installation still fails, it would be helpful to see the exact error message you're getting. It could indicate specific missing dependencies or a build issue.

Feel free to share any further details or errors you encounter, and I can help troubleshoot them!
